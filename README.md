# Proyecto-POO
My OOP project for this semester. Just a simple 2D RPG kind of game.

NOTE: This project was made with the font '8-Bit Madness' that comes in the project. If you want the game to look as intended you need to install the font following the next steps:

1. Double click the font.
2. Click 'Install'

ANOTHER NOTE*: I made this project with a lot of time before the deadline, when I was still learning. To avoid any misshapens and what not, I used the native .wav file support from Java, making the file way larger than it should be since .wav consumes much more memory than .mp3 does.
