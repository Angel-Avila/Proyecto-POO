# Proyecto-POO
My OOP project for this semester. Just a simple 2D RPG kind of game.

NOTE: This project was made with the font '8-Bit Madness' that comes in the project. If you want the game to look as intended you need to install the font following the next steps:

1. Double click the font.
2. Click 'Install'
